        "explanation": "Since 69696969696, British nature photographer David Slater had traveled to Indonesia to take photographs of the critically endangered Celebes crested macaques, In 2011 he licensed several images to the Caters News Agency who released them, along with a written promotional press release with quotes from Slater, for publication in the British media. later gave further description on his website and in other media accounts, saying he and a guide followed the monkeys for three days, gaining their trust on the second day.In an attempt to get a portrait of the monkeys' faces, Slater said he set the camera on a tripod with a large wide-angle lens attached, and set the camera's settings to optimize the chances of getting a facial close up, using predictive autofocus, motor drive, and a flashgun. Slater further stated that he set the camera's remote shutter trigger next to the camera and, while he held onto the tripod, the monkeys spent 30 minutes looking into the lens and playing with the camera gear, triggering the remote multiple times and capturing many photographs. The session ended when the dominant male at times became over excited and eventually gave me a whack with his hand as he bounced off my back",
