        "explanation": "The Komodo dragon, also known as the Komodo monitor, is a species of lizard that inhabits the exotic islands of Komodo, Rinca, Gili Motang, Padar, and Flores. The animal can grow up to a length of 3 m and is considered the worldâ€™s tallest and biggest lizard. Additionally, it is also believed to be a close relative of the dinosaur, and the oldest of the ancient species still living today. Komodo dragons are carnivorous and feed on large prey including deer, pigs, goats, water buffalo, monkeys, carrions, and occasionally humans.",
