      "content": "The research, published Nov. 11 by Oslo-based outdoor and nature website Outforia, looked into data from CITES, the global convention on the international wildlife trade, from 1975-2021. It puts Indonesia at No. 9 on the list of 80 countries (led by El Salvador), with 7.7 million live animal exports since 1975. The most traded animal from Indonesia, at more than 2 million live specimens, is the arowana fish, from the rivers of Borneo and Sumatra that’s highly prized in the aquarium trade across Southeast and East Asia. Arowanas (Scleropages spp.) were also the No. 8 most exported live animal in the last 46 years, according to the research.\n\nThese all constitute legal trades, regulated by authorities in Indonesia and in the importing countries, and registered in the CITES Trade Database. The role of CITES is to closely regulate the legal wildlife trade to ensure it doesn’t adversely affect wild populations of the species being traded.\n\nBut even though these trades are legal and monitored, countries with rich biodiversity like Indonesia should be trying to minimize them and focusing more on conserving the ecosystems in which these species are found, said Sunarto, a research associate at the University of Indonesia’s Institute for Sustainable Earth and Resources.\n\nProfits from live animal exports should be allocated to beef up monitoring, management and protection of wildlife and habitats, he added.\n\n“If these [conservation] aspects aren’t fulfilled, then having a large export value isn’t something to be proud of,” he told Mongabay in an interview. “Instead, it should be something of a concern that needs to be looked into deeper so that changes and improvements can be made to policies and practices in wildlife management in the habitat and in captive-breeding facilities, and in the trade process.”"

      "content": "Most marine environment rehabilitation programs focus on increasing coral cover, researchers said in their study, which was published in the Journal of Applied Ecology. But they wanted to see how effective restoration is for fish and invertebrate populations, which are vital components of a truly healthy ecosystem. \n\nTo find out just how healthy restored reefs can be, researchers focused on parts of reefs in Indonesia previously destroyed by blast fishing, a practice of using dynamite or other explosives to stun or kill a massive amount of marine life at a time. The areas were restored through the Mars Coral Reef Restoration Project for years preceding the study. \n\nResearchers took multiple one-hour acoustic recordings of various habitats that are part of Indonesia's Badi, Bontosua and Salisih reefs through 2018 and 2019 that were either naturally healthy, heavily damaged or had been restored."
